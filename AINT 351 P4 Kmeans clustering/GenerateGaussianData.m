function [data targetVec] = GenerateGaussianData(samples , Mean1, Sigma1, Mean2, Sigma2)
% Generates a two-class dataset in matrix 'data' with 2D data vectors and 
% also indicates each pattern class in the matrix 'targetVec'

% Function first generates 'samples' 2-d data vectors of class 1 by independently 
% drawing each dimension from a  Gaussian distribution.
% parameters Mean1, Sigma1 specify the mean vector and covariance matrix for class 1
% class 1 patterns have an associated output label vector in matrix targetVec [1 0]'  

% Function then generates 'samples' 2-d data vectors of class 2 by independently 
% drawing each dimension from a  Gaussian distribution. 
% parameters Mean2, Sigma2 specify the mean vector and covariance matrix for class 2
% class 2 patterns have an associated output label vector in matrix targetVec[0 1]'


% The two sets of class1 and class2 data are then concatenated into the
% output  matrix 'data'
% similarly the label vectors are concatenated onto the output matrix
% 'targetVec'

% Both output matrices therefore have size = (2, 2 * samples)
